For years, integrit was in a near-perpetual feature freeze in order to
avoid creeping featurism.  However, the lack of a project "heartbeat"
was sometimes mistaken as death, and now little fixes are most
welcome.

The mailing lists are appropriate forums for discussions of features
and fixes.

Recommendations for patches:

  Patches for portability and correctness are especially welcome.
  Please make patches against the latest version of integrit.

  The very latest is the master branch on github at the URL below, and
  pull requests directed to this repo are the best way to submit
  changes:

    https://github.com/ecashin/integrit

  But patches against the latest stable release on sourceforge.net are
  fine.
  
  Stand-alone patches should be context diffs or (better) unified
  diffs.  Only substantive changes should be in the patches.  (e.g.,
  reformatting the whitespace is not a substantive change and will
  make a patch unreadable.)  Please use one patch for each logical
  change.
  
  There is no guarantee that submitted patches will be accepted.  Some
  of the patches that have been submitted so far have been directly
  applicable; some have contained helpful ideas; and some have contained
  changes that would have made integrit less portable, less general,
  less reliable, or less coherent.
